Alon.
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.
Alon.
Prithee, peace.
Alon.
I prithee, spare.
Alon.
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too.
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?
Alon.
No, no, he's gone.
Alon.
Prithee, peace.
Alon.
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
Alon.
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
            All sleep except Alon., Seb., and Ant.
Alon.
Thank you.--Wondrous heavy.
                                Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel.
Alon.
Why, how now? ho, awake!--Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?
Alon.
I heard nothing.
Alon.
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
Alon.
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
For my poor son.
Alon.
Lead away.
Alon.
Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
Alon.
What harmony is this?--My good friends, hark!
Alon.
Give us kind keepers, heavens!--What were these?
Alon.
I cannot too much muse
Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing--
Although they want the use of tongue--a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse.
Alon.
Not I.
Alon.
I will stand to, and feed,
Although my last: no matter, since I feel
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
Stand to, and do as we.
Their proper selves.    Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords.
                   You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
And will not be uplifted. But remember,--
For that's my business to you,--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
Lingering perdition--worse than any death
Can be at once--shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,--
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.
Alon.
O, it is monstrous, monstrous!
Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded; and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded,
And with him there lie mudded.    Exit.
Alon.
Whether thou be'st he or no,
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave--
An if this be at all--a most strange story.
Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. --But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?
Alon.
If thou be'st Prospero,
Give us particulars of thy preservation;
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.
Alon.
Irreparable is the loss; and patience
Says it is past her cure.
Alon.
You the like loss!
Alon.
A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter?
Alon.
If this prove
A vision of the island, one dear son
Shall I twice lose.
Alon.
Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise, and say how thou camest here.
Alon.
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
And brought us thus together?
Alon.
I am hers:
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness!
Alon.
I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
Alon.
to Fer. and Mir. Give me your hands:
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy!
Alon.
These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
Alon.
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.
Alon.
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
Alon.
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?--
How camest thou in this pickle?
Alon.
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
                                Pointing to Caliban.
Alon.
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
Alon.
I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.
