	/**
	 * Method: sieveOfEratosthenes
	 * This method takes a boolean array
	 * This method changes all non-prime numbers up to the length of the array to false
	 * 
	 * This method is by far one of the most difficult we have had so far
	 * 
	 * A boolean array is like a row of light switches.
	 * For this method they all should start up, ON, or true
	 * If a light switch is ON, then the number is prime.
	 * Your code should start at the number 2, and turn all 2's off
	 * It should then go to 3 and turn all 3's off.
	 * It should then go to 4 and turn all 4's off (you can skip this if you want)
	 * etc.
	 * 
	 * To find out how many elements are in an array, you use the array name, a period
	 * and the keyword length.
	 *

		//Yes, this is a double for loop, or a for loop inside a for loop
		//You will really need to think about this.  Just dropping in numbers won't do it
		//Remember for loops have 3 important things.  A starting point, and ending point,
		//and an increment.  You can change all 3 items.
		
		//You may want to figure out the inside for loop first, i.e. get it to remove all
		//the 2's.  Then wrap a for loop around that and make the inside for loop more 
		//general
